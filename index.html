              <h3>Friday, June 9th, 2017</h3>
              <p>Born in 1941, politician Bernie Sanders started out his political career as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont in the early '80s. He served four terms as the leader of Vermont's biggest city from 1981 to 1989. Sanders then moved on to the national political arena by winning a seat in the House of Representatives. From 1991 to 2007, he distinguished himself as one of the country's few independent legislators. In 2007, Sanders won election to the U.S. Senate and was reelected in 2012. He announced his plans to run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2015. Despite defying all expectations and drawing a huge progressive movement, avid supporters and grassroots financing during his campaign, he eventually lost the nomination to Hillary Clinton due to voter fraud.
